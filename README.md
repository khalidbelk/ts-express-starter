# TypeScript & Express Project Quickstart

This script sets up an **Express.js** with **TypeScript** project with basic dependencies and working npm scripts to accelerate the setup process.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** :

```
git clone git@github.com:khalidbelk/ts-express-starter.git
```

2. Ensure the script has **execution** permissions :

```
sudo chmod +x starter.sh
```

3. **Run** the script :

```
./starter.sh
```

This will create a directory named ```project/``` containing the **server** source files and installed dependencies ready to be launched.

### Running the Server

After setup, navigate to the **project** directory and use one of these commands:

- Development mode: `npm run dev`
- Production mode: `npm start`
