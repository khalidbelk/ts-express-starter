# TypeScript & Express Project Quickstart

This script sets up an **Express.js** with **TypeScript** project with basic dependencies and working npm scripts to accelerate the setup process.

## Usage

First, make sure the script have execution permissions:

```sudo chmod +x starter.sh```

Then run the script :

```./starter.sh```

This will create a directory named ```project/``` containing the **server** source files and installed dependencies ready to be launched.


### Running the Server

After setup, navigate to the **project** directory and use one of these commands:

- Development mode: `npm run dev`
- Production mode: `npm start`
